# Aqua - Source Engine Base

A base for modding the source engine (internally), It can be used for creating mods/cheats.

*Supports pretty much every source engine game except for L4d2/Portal 2/Titanfall*

Created in mid-2015.

Functional and a lot better than most public bases out there(At the time of writing)
